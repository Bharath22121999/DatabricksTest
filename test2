Subject: Resignation Letter with Apology for Recent Performance and Additional Context

Hi Team,

I hope this email finds you well. It is with a heavy heart that I compose this letter to officially tender my resignation from Infosys, effective 1st March.

Firstly, I want to express my deepest apologies for any inconvenience caused by my recent performance. I understand the importance of maintaining a high standard of work, and I am truly sorry for falling short of expectations. I believe in accountability, and I want to take full responsibility for the lapses in my work during the past week.

The primary reason for my below-par performance has been an unfortunate accident that not only resulted in the breakage of my work laptop but also caused significant mental distress. This incident disrupted my usual workflow and contributed to the challenges I faced in responding effectively on Teams and attending calls promptly. Subsequently, I had to rely on my personal laptop, which was not equipped with the necessary tools and software for efficient work. Despite these setbacks, I continued to work on the assigned items to the best of my ability.

The accident also had a profound impact on my mental well-being, exacerbating personal and family issues that I have been struggling with. These challenges have significantly affected my ability to concentrate fully on my work responsibilities. It's been a period marked by mental instability and suffering, which I deeply regret has influenced my performance and the team's overall dynamics.

I want to assure you that I have explored all possible avenues to address these personal matters, but unfortunately, they persist and demand my immediate attention. I am fully committed to taking responsibility for any outstanding tasks and will ensure that all my work and PRs are shared with the team for a smooth handover.

I deeply regret any inconvenience my situation may have caused to the team and the projects we were working on. I understand the importance of seamless communication and collaboration, and I sincerely apologize for any disruptions.

In addition to expressing my apologies, I would like to express my gratitude to Infosys for the opportunities provided to me during my tenure. I have learned a great deal and have had the privilege of working with talented and dedicated colleagues. Stepping away from such a team and company is not easy for me, and I hold both in high regard.

I am committed to ensuring a smooth transition and am more than willing to assist in the training or handover process to minimize disruption to ongoing projects. I appreciate your understanding in this matter and am grateful for the opportunities and experiences I have gained while working here. I wish the team continued success in all future endeavors and look forward to maintaining professional connections with everyone at Infosys.

Thank you for your understanding and support during my time here. Please know that if anything is required from my side to facilitate this transition or address any pending issues, I am fully prepared to take responsibility and complete it.

Sincerely,

Sivasai Sriramdas
